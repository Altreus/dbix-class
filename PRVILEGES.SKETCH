Ash's thoughts on privilege/GRANT abstraction for DBIC

So my first thought was some hideous mismash of lots of functions like:
->grant($user, $schema, \@privileges)

But DB2 and Oracle both support groups - and its a bit evil

So while driving to badminton I came up with the following "idea".

->grant({ user => $user, object => $table_or_object, privileges => \@privs})
->grant({ group => $group, ... <as above> })
->grant({ user=> $user, add_to_group => $group});

Thoughts?
